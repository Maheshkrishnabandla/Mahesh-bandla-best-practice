# I will Git good!

#### What is one benefit of using version control?
* The Git version control system helps any team to track the changes of an individual in a team.
* It also helps to revert the code to the previous version if something goes wrong with the latest changes and build.
* It is also helpful for any individual of any team if they are trying to create or introduce a new feature to the software they can test their code locally using their feature branch without affecting the actual code and production environment.

#### What is something new you learned about Git this week?
* I learned that a markdown file can be used as a multipurpose file, for ex.. styling text in this file using syntax to give styles to the text.
* I used to work on a Git Version control system which is integrated into the AZURE DEVOPS portal in my previous organization where I didn't have an opportunity to work on an actual Git Version control system so looking forward to great learning.
